How to compile *.java files?

To compile Java files locally, you'll need to have few things in locally. 

1. Java Development Kit (JDK):
   The JDK is necessary for compiling and running Java programs.
   
3. Set up Java Environment Variables:
   After installing the JDK, you'll need to set up the following environment variables:
   JAVA_HOME: Points to the directory where the JDK is installed.

Compiling and Running Java Files:

1. Navigate to the folder containing the Java file in your terminal (using cd command)
2. Compile the Java file using:
   javac ${file}.java
   Example:
   javac anvi.java     //If successfully runs the compilation, you will get a file
   anvi.class
3. Run the compiled class file using:
   java anvi  //It will run the Java program in the terminal or MS-DOS.
4. To make java archive (.jar) from the compiled class file
5. Create MANIFEST.MF file with the content below,
   echo -e "Manifest-Version: 1.0\nCreated-By: Thangadurai, Murugan\nMain-Class: anvi" > MANIFEST.MF
5. jar cmf MANIFEST.MF anvi.jar anvi.class
6. java -jar anvi.jar  (OR) 
   java -cp anvi.jar anvi   // some reason the manifest ignored
